# This is a .gitignore file, which is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore when checking for changes in a project.
# By adding files or directories to this list, Git will ignore them and they will not be included in the project's repository.

# The first line specifies the location of Git's documentation on ignoring files.
# This can be helpful for learning more about how to use .gitignore files effectively.

# The remaining lines are examples of files and directories that are commonly ignored in Node.js projects.
# Each line starts with a file path, followed by a comment explaining what the line does.

# The first section includes directories related to dependencies and package management tools.
# These directories often contain large files that don't need to be tracked by Git.
/node_modules    # Directory for storing Node.js modules
/.pnp            # Directory for storing prebuilt dependency graphs
.pnp.js          # File for storing the prebuilt dependency graph

# The second section includes directories related to testing.
# These directories often contain temporary files that are generated during testing.
/coverage        # Directory for storing test coverage reports

# The third section includes directories related to production builds.
# These directories often contain compiled or minified files that are generated during the build process.
/build           # Directory for storing compiled and minified files

# The fourth section includes miscellaneous files that are commonly ignored.
.DS_Store         # File used by macOS to store folder view settings
.env.*            # Files for storing environment variables
npm-debug.log*    # Log files generated by npm
yarn-debug.log*   # Log files generated by Yarn
yarn-error.log*  # Error logs generated by Yarn
