# .gitignore file
# This file is used to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore when checking for changes in a project.
# By adding files or directories to this list, Git will ignore them and they will not be included in the project's repository.

# Git documentation on ignoring files

# Node.js dependencies and package management directories
# These directories often contain large files that don't need to be tracked by Git.

# These directories often contain temporary files that are generated during testing.
